# Sole Classifier

This repository demonstrates a simple sole classifier project using fastai and the ResNet18 architecture. The model leverages transfer learning by training only the last layer of a pretrained network for efficient adaptation to the dataset.

Check out the full implementation and details in the Google Colab notebook:

*Note: In the future, this project may be extended to include a Jupyter Notebook directly in this repository.*

This work was developed in the Condensed Matter Physics and Biological Systems Master's program at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid in 2023.
